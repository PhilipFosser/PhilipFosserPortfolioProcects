title: "A portfolio website by Philip Fosser"

Hello there! My name is Philip, and this is my portfolio website, as you can probably surmise by the title of this homepage. If you are reading this, odds are you are either a recruiter, or someone else served with the responsibility of vetting potential candidates for a position. If so, I hope this website serves as proof of my abilities to R, as a tool for data analysis and reporting. There is also a chance that the person reading this is my beautiful girlfriend, if so, I love you and the sleep analysis tab is meant to inspire you to take your sleep more seriously!

This website, as mentioned, is meant as proof of my abilities to use coding as a tool for documentation, analyzing, visualizing etc. It is also meant as a opportunity for me to practice my coding skills. Because this is a website, I'm also forced to learn how to use some basic HTML, Markdown, CSS, YAML and lastly how Github works.
